Keeloq for ChipWhisperer
========================

This is a set of tools to study power analysis of the Keeloq cipher.  It
is based on and integrated with the ChipWhisperer software.

The Keeloq algorithm is very simple, yet omni-present in our current
world, making it an easy target to learn power analysis with.

Tutorials and example traces are provided for quick entry, even without
having to buy any specialized hardware.

Implementation and documentation copyright 2016 by Marc.

Toolset overview
----------------

### Keeloq data capture

Loose collection of utilities to capture Keeloq data transmissions and
annotate them to power traces.

  - GNURadio flow to receive and demodulate RF messages
  - Keeloq OOK decoder to convert baseband to HEX values
  - [Script to annotate HEX values](../hex_to_npy/hex_to_npy.py) to traces captured with ChipWhisperer


### Preprocessing filter: Resync Slice-to-Slot

Powerful plugin to prepare traces for analysis.

  - Compensate for RC oscillator clock drift
  - Extract arbitrary point ranges from each round
  - Compress rounds to single point values
  - Visually separate rounds with zero-padding


### Trace Explorer partition modes: Keeloq (various)

Several partition modes relevant to the Keeloq algorithm.  Useful for visual
exploration, understanding the attacks, and even executing them manually.

  - **Bit (various)**: Partition by ciphertext output or intermediate
                       LSB/MSB value
  - **HD (various)**:  Partition by Hamming distance of status register
                       during shift operations


### Attack module: Keeloq DPA

Container for several automatted attacks:

  - **Encoder Bit model**: Attacks the intermediate MSB bit value.
  - **Encoder HD model**:  Attacks the status register Hamming distance
                           during shift operations.
