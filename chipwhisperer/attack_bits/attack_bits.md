Bit model attack on Keeloq HCS301 encoder
=========================================

The bit model attack is simple but works very well against the
(cheap & robust) HCS301 encoder chip.  Note that the
[Keeloq algorithm](../keeloq_algorithm/keeloq_algorithm.md)
itself is bit-based too.

Covers:

  - Load and inspect trace plots
  - Use _Trace Explorer_ and partition modes to locate leakage
  - Recover round timing
  - Recover key bits manually, using _Trace Explorer_
  - Interpret unexpected results
  - How to use the automatic key recovery script

_______________________________________________________________________


Step 1: Load the power traces into CWAnalyzer
---------------------------------------------

You will need at least 200-300 annotated power captures of an encoder
chip.  If you don't have any, you can use one of the following example
traces:

- [HCS301 sync](../examples_hcs301/HCS301_sync.zip)
> 
  No fancy preprocessing other than sychronization.  This is
  sub-optimal for attacking, because there is a lot of irrelevant
  data which can mask the good data.  **For learning** however,
  these traces are better suited and will give you much better
  insight.
      
- [HCS301 bits full](../examples_hcs301/HCS301_bits_full.zip)
> 
  Easier to work with. Much of the irrelevant noise has been
  removed already and rounds are easily distinguished during
  visual inspection.

- [HCS301 bits peak](../examples_hcs301/HCS301_bits_peak.zip)
> 
  Best for attacking.  The bit leakage is condensed into single
  peaks, there are no distractions.

Download and uncompress the example traces, or get your own traces
ready.

Run CWAnalyzer and open one of the projects with the traces.

Find the _Trace Output Plot_ dock on the right-hand side, and
select the _Trace Output Plot_ tab.  You will now see the trace
waveform.

![Power trace plot](01a_traces_loaded.png)

**Exercise**:

  - Use the mouse to inspect details, zooming in and out.

**Tips**:

  - Enable _Move_ mode (right-most icon above the plot), so
    you can grab and pan the plot with the left button.  The
    right button zooms: click and hold, and move the mouse.

  - On the left-hand side, in the _Results_ tab, way down, is
    an item _Trace Output Plot_ and _Trace Range_.  Here you
    can specify which range of traces you want to see (default:
    0-7).  Click _redraw_ to update the display.

_______________________________________________________________________

Step 2: Identify the points of ciphertext leakage
-------------------------------------------------

**If you're lazy and just want to try the automatic mode,
  skip to 'Step 5: Automatic key recovery'**

Or, continue reading and look where ciphertext leaks:

The ciphertext is produced in the last 32 rounds of the encryption
process, and is 32 bits wide.  The ciphertext is known, because it is
part of the encoded RF message.  Make sure that your traces contain
correct ciphertext data (the example traces do).

Select the _Trace Explorer_ tab (on left-hand side).  Click _enabled_
if it isn't already clicked, to see the configuration parameters.

Configure

  - Comparison Mode = Welch's T-Test
  - Partiton Mode = Keeloq: bit(status\[all\])
  - Color Palette = Rainbow

then click _Display_ to run the partition algorithm.  A new dock
_Partition Comparison Graph_ will open and show the ciphertext
leakage.

You can re-arrange the plot dock windows, and close unnecessary
ones to gain screen estate (use the _Windows_ menu to get them
back later).  For example like this:

![Leakage plot of ciphertext](02a_ciphertext_leakage.png)

_Screenshot: Ciphertext leakage (top) versus power trace (bottom)_

A rainbow-colored group of peaks is clearly visible, starting
after point 14000.  Each color represents a different bit of the
32-bit ciphertext (see legend below the plot).

**Exercises**:

  - Zoom in to inspect shape and width of the peaks, and the
    spacing in between.  The latter is equivalent to the **round
    timing** (the algorithm produces one bit per round).

  - Use the legend to enable and disable single bits (by clicking).
    Find out in which order the chip calculates the bits.

  - Align the leakage plot with the power trace plot and
    determine which portion of the waveform leaks information
    about the ciphertext.

  - Identify where bit 31 of the ciphertext leaks.  Why are
    there many peaks?  Which one is the 'correct' one?  Find
    my guess in the footnoteÂ¹.

    > 
      It may be impossible to toggle bit 31 on narrow displays
      (legend is cut off midway, like in the screenshot above).
      If this happens to you, you have two remedies:  Either
      maximize CWAnalyzer and the _Partition Comparison Graph_
      dock to uncover as many buttons as possible.  Or, change
      _Partition Mode_ to _Keeloq: bit(status\[msb\])_ and then
      click _Display_ to show **only bit 31**.

**Tips**:

  - Dial _Alpha_ down a bit (right-click inside the plot to
    get the context menu, then _Plot Options_ and _Alpha_) to
    blend many traces into a more meaningful display.

  - Use different _Color Palette_ choices (in _Trace Explorer_
    configuration parameters), depending on what information
    you are looking for.  Click _Display_ to update the plot.
    
      - _Rainbow_ is great for groups of bits.
      - _Accessible_ works best for a small number of bits where
         every difference counts.
      - _Monochrome_ helps spotting outliers vs mainstream.  Pair
         it with _Alpha_ blending!  Also serves to concentrate on
         shapes only.

_Screenshot: Ciphertext bits 1 (blue) and 0 (red) versus power trace (bottom)_

_______________________________________________________________________


Step 3: Discover hidden internal state through leakage
------------------------------------------------------

### Use ciphertext bit 31 for orientation

Ciphertext bit 31 is of particular interest, because it is the
earliest known bit.  Every leaked bit preceeding bit 31 is an
internal state bit, and reveals one key bit.

Select the _Trace Explorer_ tab and configure

  - Comparison Mode = Welch's T-Test
  - Partiton Mode = Keeloq: bit(status\[msb\])
  - Color Palette = Two colors

Then click _Display_.

Zoom and pan the plot so that bit 31 is at the right, and at
least 3 more rounds are visible on the left.  For _HCS301 sync_
that would be range 13200-14000.


### Show round 496 (the bit preceeding ciphertext bit 31)

Select the _Attack Script Generator_ tab (left-hand side), then
set

  - Attack = Keeloq DPA

Select the _Attack_ tab to see the configuration parameters for
Keeloq.  Find the _Analysis Options (for Partition modes)_
area and set

  - Known keystream = 0
> 
  This instructs the Keeloq partition mode to undo the last
  round of encryption, using 0 as key bit.

Return to the _Trace Explorer_ tab and click _Display_.

Note how the peak jumps one round to the left.  You are looking
at leakage produced by the **internal state**.


### Show more rounds

Repeat the above for _Known keystream_ values of 0, 1, 00, 01,
10, and 11.  Write down where you have found the peak for each
keystream (some results will not have a peak).

About the _Known keystream_ parameter:
> 
  The keystream bits are applied from left to right in decrypt
  operations.  Every bit undoes one round, setting the internal
  status register to what it was in the previous round.  You are
  looking at the MSB of status in round 528 - sizeof(keystream).
>
  Only 0 and 1 characters are used as key bits, everything else
  is ignored.

**Exercises**:

  - Look at your results and think about what they mean.  The
    solution is found below in the next step.

  - Optional: Repeat with 3 keystream bits 000, 001, 010, 011,
    100, 101, 110, 111.

Step 4: Discussion and manual key bit recovery
----------------------------------------------

For _HCS301 sync_ you probably have found this:

>	
>	
	| Key | Peak pos     | Round | Notes   |
	|-----|--------------|-------|---------|
    |     | ..........X. |  497  |         |
	| 0   | .......X.... |  496  |         |
	| 1   | .......X.... |  496  |         |
	| 00  | ....X....... |  495  |         |
	| 01  | ....X....... |  495  |         |
	| 10  | ............ |  495  |         |
	| 11  | ............ |  495  |         |
	| 000 | ............ |  494  |         |
	| 001 | ............ |  494  |         |
	| 010 | .X.......... |  494  |         |
	| 011 | .X.......... |  494  |         |
	| 100 | .x.......... |  494  | unclear |
	| 101 | .x.......... |  494  | unclear |
	| 110 | .x.......... |  494  | unclear |
	| 111 | .x.......... |  494  | unclear |



### Observation 1: Results seem to come in pairs

0 and 1 have a peak.  00 and 01 also have one. 10 and 11 have none
(forming a pair too).

**Exercise**:

  - Calculate 0 again, and zoom to the peak full-screen.  Then
    calculate 1 and watch the difference.

You'll find that there is no difference at all between pairs that
share all bits except the LSB.

This is caused by an interaction between (bit-based) Keeloq and
T-Test with 2 partitions.  The key bit is mixed into the
attacked bit with a linear operation (XOR).  The partitioning
mode thus creates the same two groups of traces, just swapped
around depending on the bit value.  The absolute differences
between them will always be the same.  Think distance from
A to B, versus B to A.   The effect disappears when more
keystream bits are used, thanks to the non-linear behavior of
Keeloq (NLF).

**Tip**:

  - Disregard the last bit as distinguisher, and/or append a
    _dummy bit_ where convenient.

Update your table, ignoring the last bit:

>	
>	
	| Key | Peak pos     | Round | Notes   |
	|-----|--------------|-------|---------|
    |     | ..........X. |  497  |         |
	| x   | .......X.... |  496  |         |
	| 0x  | ....X....... |  495  |         |
	| 1x  | ............ |  495  |         |
	| 00x | ............ |  494  |         |
	| 01x | .X.......... |  494  |         |
	| 10x | .x.......... |  494  | unclear |
	| 11x | .x.......... |  494  | unclear |


### Observation 2: No peaks for 1x and 00x

1x shows no peak, while its partner 0x does.  This suggests
that 0x correlates with the measured behavior of the chip,
and models it correctly to a high degree.  1x does not
correlate, it has nothing in common with this chip.

> 
  The first recovered keystream bit seems to be a 0.
  Congratulations!

Now look at 00x vs its partner 01x.  00x does not correlate,
while 01x does.

> 
  Ignoring the unclear results of 10x and 11x for a moment,
  the 2nd keystream bit would be a 1.


### Observation 3: Unclear results for 10x and 11x

There are 'weak' peaks for 10x and 11x.  Neither are very
clear, and they are incompatible with the previous findings.

Power analysis is about choosing the most likely outcome.
If we had accepted 0x as correct from the start, we'd never
have calculated results at 1Xx.  The question is how deep
to explore the tree of options before accepting something
as correct (think: chess program analysis depth).

Possible interpretations of the unclear results:

> 
  **Optimistic**:  A unclear decision at this branch means
    that neither choice models the chip better than the
    other.  We must have lost track earlier (before
    reaching this branch), and can stop here.

> 
  **Pessimistic**:  Noise could have affected the
    quality at this branch.  We should explore deeper
    below it to clarify.

**Exercise**:

  - Explore a few random locations below branch 1Xx and
    compare them to what you find below branch 01x (at
    the same depth).  Don't forget to adapt your zoom to
    see the additional rounds!

**Tips**:

  - Keeloq is not very non-linear.  Even wrong paths can
    correlate at times, especially when you use few traces.

  - Noisy or weak results in a round for **all** tested
    keystreams?  Maybe there was noise at this point of time,
    for example from another component operating in
    parallel.  Sometimes you can see such noise in the
    _Power Trace View_.
    
    Identify the noisy point range, and skip over it by
    inserting all possible values for the affected round(s).
    The correlation behavior past the noise helps you
    get back on track.

  - Enhance the readability of your keystream by adding
    whitespace, questionmarks, and other notes in the
    _Known keystream_ field.  Everything but 0 and 1 is
    ignored.


______________________________________________________________________


Step 5: Automatic key recovery
------------------------------

Select the _Attack Script Generator_ tab (left-hand side), then
set

  - Attack = Keeloq DPA

Click the _Attack_ icon (in the tool bar above) to run the
script.

![Progress diaglog with key=300X........7114](05a_progress.png)

_Screenshot: Progress dialog with current key guess_


Once the script is over, the result is visible in the _Debug
Logging_ dock.  Use the _Windows_ menu to make it visible, if
you have closed it before.

The final key guess is printed in one of the last lines.  Also,
it is used to decrypt the ciphertexts of all traces.  For
sequential captures, the resulting plaintexts should follow
the expected pattern, otherwise the key guess is not correct.

### Algorithm description

The current implementation is very simple.  It follows the
highest peak at each junction, and never tracks back.

The highest peak is selected either from the whole trace
(or rather the configured point range).  Or, if round
timing is given, the detection can be limited to just
the range of each round.  The latter works with fewer
traces.

Round timing can be specified below _Timing Setup_ (in
the _Attack_ tab).  In step 2 you have already learned
how to recover round timing.  For the _HCS301 sync_
example traces, configure

  - Round 528 (pos)       = 20000
  - Round width (samples) = 200

then enable _Utilize round timing_ (at the bottom).

**Exercises**:

  - Run the script with fewer traces (below _Trace Setup_:
    _Starting trace_ and _Traces per attack_) and find the
    minimum number of traces for successful key recovery.

  - Compare the minimum number with and without using
    round timing.

  - Try the _HCS301 bits peak_ example traces.

Notes
-----

Â¹ Ciphertext bit 31 has many leakage peaks:
> 
  The correct peak is the one that fits nicely into the pattern
  of the other bits.  The group defines the round timing.  Bit 31
  is the earliest bit produced by the chip, therefore it is to
  the left of bit 30.  To the right of bit 0 (the last bit
  produced), the algorithm is over and additional peaks are
  meaningless.
>
  In the _HCS301 sync_ example, the good peak is at 13855-13865.
> 
  The extra peaks after 20200 are side-effects of the particular
  hardware implementation.  Probably the core is clocked for some
  more time to complete internal cleanup.  For example, to transfer
  the ciphertext out to the next processing stage, to re-align the
  key register for the next encryption, etc.
